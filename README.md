# AffordanceMapping

Code for our paper on mapping body-affordances for dimensionality reduction of spaces of actions.

The best-documented example is the Hexapod code, which has comments discussing architectural
choices of the neural networks and the detailed procedure for training. The reacher code has
many common elements and the detailed explanations are not repeated there.
